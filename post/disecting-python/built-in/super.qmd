title: Built-in function `super()`
---

This example is given:

```python
class C(B):
    def method(self, arg):
        super().method(arg)  # This does the same thing as:
        # super(C, self).method(arg)
```

But, if you would try to be clever and do `super(type(self), self)`, then the
code can easily break in unexpected ways.

```{python}
#| error: true
class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        super(type(self), self).__init__()

class Child(Parent):
    pass

Child()
```
